## HouseKeeping

### Objectives

* Give you an first understanding about Blockchain and Web3.
* Present the limitations of blockchains for realtime applications and how off-loading can help.

<details>
<summary><b> 1Ô∏è‚É£ Can I run this workshop on my computer?</b></summary>
<hr>
<p>There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine, If you do so, you will need the following
<ol>
<li><b>git</b> installed on your local system
<li><b>Javascript</b> installed on your local system
<li><b>Npm, Typescript</b> installed on your local system
</ol>
</p>
In this readme, we try to provide instructions for local development as well - but keep in mind that the main focus is development on Gitpod, hence <strong>We can't guarantee live support</strong> about local development in order to keep on track with the schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to succeed.

## 1. Database Initialization

### 1.1 - Create an Astra Account

> **Note**: **Datastax Astra** is a cloud-native, fully managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS) based on Apache Cassandra. It provides a scalable, performant and highly available database solution without the operational overhead of managing Cassandra clusters. Astra supports both SQL and NoSQL APIs, and includes features like backup and restore, monitoring and alerting, and access control. It enables developers to focus on application development while the database infrastructure is managed by Datastax.

- `‚úÖ 1.1.a` - Access [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.dev/yt-03-08) and register with `Google` or `Github` account

![](img/astra-login.png?raw=true")

### 1.2 - Create an Astra Token

```diff
- ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT MANDATORY DURING THE LIVE WORKSHOP
```

- `‚úÖ 1.2.a` Locate `Settings` (#1) in the menu on the left, then `Token Management` (#2) 

- `‚úÖ 1.2.b`Select the role `Organization Administrator` before clicking `[Generate Token]`

![](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-for-data-engineers/blob/main/images/setup-astra-2.png?raw=true)

- `‚úÖ 1.2.c` - Copy your token in the clipboard. With this token we will now create what is needed for the training.

## 2. - Astra Block Quick Start

Astra Block is a blockchain data service that offers real-time indexed blockchain data for building Web3 and decentralized applications (dapps).

With Astra Block, you can stream a sanitized blockchain dataset into an Astra database in real-time. The second a new block is mined, your Astra database will immediately be updated with the new, clean blockchain data.
